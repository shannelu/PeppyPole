# Peppy Pole
Code & documentation for the CPEN 541 term project: Peppy Pole: An Anthropomorphic and Interactive Hiking Companion
Authored by Sahar Mavali, Ursa Maity, and Shanny Lu

#### Project Description

The Peppy Pole, an anthropomorphicand interactive hiking pole prototype that merges life-like featureswith the innate functionality of a hiking pole to create rich andinteractive experiences for hikers. Compared to regular or otherforms of smart hiking poles, the Peppy Pole leverages the ’poleness’of a hiking pole in its character. 

Our prototype is made up of asmartphone collecting sensor data, sending the data to an ArduinoUno that actuates the expressions of the Pole with motors. The Peppy Pole design ouline is shown below:
